        Welcome to my web portfolio! Here, you'll discover an application that replicates the interface of a classic operating system.
        Explore the projects I've been involved in, the programming technologies I've mastered, get in touch with me, and delve into details about my skills and work experience.
        Developed using <strong>PHP, MariaDB, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript</strong>, this project reflects the expertise I gained
        during Higher Vocational Education in Web Application Development. The code is fully open and accessible on <a href='https://github.com/Christian-Gimenez/PortfolioWeb'>Github</a>.
        This website goes beyond being a mere presentation; it incorporates a CRUD system, empowering the admin user to intuitively manage data
        with a nostalgic touch.
